# PureReward Reinforcement Learning (PRL) 🎖️

Elevate your AI training with the cutting-edge PRL method. Focus solely on rewards, simplifying the learning process while still navigating towards goals effectively.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **Positive-Only Learning**: Emphasizes positive rewards, streamlining the decision-making process.
- **Simplified Feedback**: Removes the complications of penalties, making learning more intuitive.
- **Adaptable**: Easily integrated into various environments, from grid-worlds to complex simulations.
- **Modern Approach**: A fresh take on reinforcement learning, tailored for environments where positive feedback dominates.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone and Navigate**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd PRL-Implementation
   ```
2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
3. **Kickstart PureReward Learning**:
   ```bash
   python prl_starter.py
